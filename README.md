# Nixlet

An experimental security-focused OS made primarily for embedded situations, based on NixOS. It is fully image-based and automatically handles OTA updates generated by CI.

The releases section contains some generic system profiles.

## Usage

Nixlet can be used as a library to generate your own image-based NixOS systems. See `flake.nix` for usage.

Partition selection is based on the image UUID. It should be different for every version released.

## Disk layout

| Name     | Contents                     |
| -------- | ---------------------------- |
| ESP      | Bootloader and kernel images |
| Root A/B | Read-only system images      |
| Data     | User data                    |

The data partition is encrypted with LUKS (default password is blank). Support for secure boot signing and Nix store verification is in progress.

## Notes

- NixOS unstable is required for now due to the use of bleeding-edge features in various systemd components. NixOS 24.05 will probably work once released.
